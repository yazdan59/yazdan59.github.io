GCPBayes Pipeline is a user-friendly pipeline to perform cross-phenotype gene-set analysis between two traits using GCPBayes, a method developed by our team. All analyses could be performed automatically by calling for different scripts in a simple way (using a Shiny app, Bash or R script). A Shiny application was also developed to create different plots to visualize outputs from GCPBayes.
