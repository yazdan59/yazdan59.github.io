In this Poster, we illustrated a new pipeline to use GCPBayes to detect pleiotropy between 2 traits using GWAS summary statistics data as inputs. To show its applicability, we used this pipeline it to detect  common genetic risk factors between breast cancer and ovarian cancer using data from two large consortia. We compared the highlighted genes to available findings from the literature.
