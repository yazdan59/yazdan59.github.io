%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds Stoichiometric Matrix,
 Binary Stoichiometric Matrix, and Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 This file also contains single nodes (without any edges) in Cytoscape-compatible files.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function
 Note: Currency metabolites have been considered for construction of this network. 

 [Output] = enz_cent_single_node(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                                 The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Stoich_Matrix.dat                      Stoichiometric Matrix (comma separated Format)
