<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> Builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks Removing Currency Metabolites (based-on a Library file), which could be used as an input for Kavosh Algorithm.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file, 
 and builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks which is compatible with Kavosh Algorithm.
 The Kavosh is one of the best motif finding algorithms. Its Cytoscape plugins is also called CytoKavosh.

 http://lbb.ut.ac.ir/Download/LBBsoft/CytoKavosh/CytoKavosh-Manual/cytoKavoshTutorial.html
 So, one could easily use this algorithm in order to find motifs in different sizes for the metabolic network.
 The Remove Currency Metabolites based-on Library (RCMLib) algorithm removes currency metabolites 
 in the metabolic network automatically IF AND ONLY IF the currency metabolits exists in the Library file.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_RCMLib_dir_kavosh(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                               The Library file includes pre-defined currency metabolites (in .txt format)
 Note: Library text file must include one metabolites per line (all in one column) 
 fileName2                               The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCMLib_Dir_Index.dat      Matrix Indeces of Enzyme-Enzyme Connections 
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCMLib_Dir_Kavosh.dat     Directed-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Kavosh Compatible
