%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The &quot;PostProcess&quot; Functions in this toolbox do some changes on some useful structural plugins in the Cytoscape software.
 This function reads an output (.csv format) of the CytoHubba (a Cytoscape plugin),
 and construct a new output file which has been added the name of the related SBML metabolites or reactions.
 http://hub.iis.sinica.edu.tw/cytoHubba/
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function
 Note: This function is applicable for CytoHubba analysis on Bipartite, Metabolite-Metabolite, and Enzyme-Enzyme networks (both Directed and Undirected).

 [Output] = postprocess_CytoHubba(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                        comma separated file includes CytoHubba results for a given ranking method (in .csv format)
 fileName2                        The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_fileName1_fileName2.dat        The output file which includes the name of the related SBML metabolites or reactions.
