<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> Builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks Removing Currency Metabolites and considering single nodes (without any edges)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 The Remove Currency Metabolites (RCM) algorithm removes currency metabolites in the metabolic network automatically.
 This file also contains single nodes (without any edges) in Cytoscape-compatible files.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_RCM_single_node(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                               The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Removed_Mets_RCM.dat                 file contains removed metabolits from the original model
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCM.dat                  Undirected-Enzyme-Enzyme Network (comma separated Format)
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCM_single_node_Cyt.dat  Undirected-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible
