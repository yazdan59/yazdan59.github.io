%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds an Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Network.
 For every metabolite, the algorithm checks availability in the Library file which has been prepared by user as input in .txt format).
 and removes if it exists in the library file. Then the Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Network will be created.
 This file also contains single nodes (without any edges) in Cytoscape-compatible files.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_Lib_dir_single_node(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                                   The Library file includes pre-defined currency metabolites (in .txt format)
 Note: Library text file must include one metabolites per line (all in one column) 
 fileName2                                   The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Enzyme_Cent_Lib_Dir_Single_Node_Cyt.sif   Directed-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible
