%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file,
 and builds Directed Metabolite-Metabolite Networks which is compatible with QuateXelero Algorithm.
 The QuateXelero is one of the best motif finding algorithms which is recently developed by Kavosh developer team.
 http://lbb.ut.ac.ir/Download/LBBsoft/QuateXelero
 So, one could easily use this algorithm in order to find motifs in different sizes for the metabolic network.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = met_cent_dir_quatexelero(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                                 The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Metabolite_Cent_Dir_Index.dat          Matrix Indeces of Metabolite-Metabolite Connections 
 *_Metabolite_Cent_Dir_QuateXelero.dat    Directed-Metabolite-Metabolite Network - QuateXelero Compatible
