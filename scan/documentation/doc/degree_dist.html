%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file,
 builds Undirected Metabolite-Metabolite and Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 Then, counts Metabolite and Enzyme degree distribution over these networks,
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = degree_cent(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                              The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Metabolite_Cent_Degree_Dist.dat     Metabolite degree distribution (of the undirected Network)
 *_Enzyme_Cent_Degree_Dist.dat         Enzyme degree distribution (of the undirected Network)
