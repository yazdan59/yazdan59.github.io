%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 The Remove Currency Metabolites (RCM) algorithm removes currency metabolites in the metabolic network automatically.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_RCM(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                        The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Removed_Mets_RCM.dat          file contains removed metabolits from the original model
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCM.dat           Undirected-Enzyme-Enzyme Network (comma separated Format)
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCM_Cyt.dat       Undirected-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible
