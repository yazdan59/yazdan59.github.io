%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file,
 and builds Directed Metabolite-Metabolite Networks which is compatible with Kavosh Algorithm.
 The Kavosh is one of the best motif finding algorithms. Its Cytoscape plugins is also called CytoKavosh.

 http://lbb.ut.ac.ir/Download/LBBsoft/CytoKavosh/CytoKavosh-Manual/cytoKavoshTutorial.html
 So, one could easily use this algorithm in order to find motifs in different sizes for the metabolic network.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function
