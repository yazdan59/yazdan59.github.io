%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 The Remove Currency Metabolites based-on Library (RCMLib) algorithm removes currency metabolites 
 in the metabolic network automatically IF AND ONLY IF the currency metabolits exists in the Library file.
 This file contains single nodes (without any edges) in Cytoscape-compatible files.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_RCMLib_dir_single_node(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                                      The Library file includes pre-defined currency metabolites (in .txt format)
 Note: Library text file must include one metabolites per line (all in one column) 
 fileName2                                      The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCMLib_Dir_Single_Node_Cyt.sif   Directed-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible
