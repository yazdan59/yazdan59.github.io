%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds an Undirected Enzyme-Enzyme Network.
 For every metabolite, the algorithm checks availability in the Library file which has been prepared by user as input in .txt format).
 and removes if it exists in the library file. Then the Undirected Enzyme-Enzyme Network will be created.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_Lib(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                     The Library file includes pre-defined currency metabolites (in .txt format)
 Note: Library text file must include one metabolites per line (all in one column) 
 fileName2                     The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Removed_Mets_Lib.dat        file contains removed metabolits from the original model
 *_Enzyme_Cent_Lib.dat         Undirected-Enzyme-Enzyme Network (comma separated Format)
 *_Enzyme_Cent_Lib_Cyt.dat     Undirected-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible
