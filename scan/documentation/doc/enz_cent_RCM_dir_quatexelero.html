<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> Builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks Removing Currency Metabolites which could be used as an input for QuateXelero Algorithm.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file, 
 and builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks which is compatible with QuateXelero Algorithm.
 The QuateXelero is one of the best motif finding algorithms which is recently developed by Kavosh developer team.
 http://lbb.ut.ac.ir/Download/LBBsoft/QuateXelero
 So, one could easily use this algorithm in order to find motifs in different sizes for the metabolic network.
 The Remove Currency Metabolites (RCM) algorithm removes currency metabolites in the metabolic network automatically.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_RCM_dir_quatexelero(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                                 The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
