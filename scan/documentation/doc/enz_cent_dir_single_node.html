%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file,
 and builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 This file contains single nodes (without any edges) in Cytoscape-compatible files.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function
 Note: Currency metabolites have been considered for construction of this network. 

 [Output] = enz_cent_dir_single_node(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                                The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Enzyme_Cent_Dir_Single_Node_Cyt.sif   Directed-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible (.sif file)
