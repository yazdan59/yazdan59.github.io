<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> Builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks Removing Currency Metabolites
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 The Remove Currency Metabolites (RCM) algorithm removes currency metabolites in the metabolic network automatically.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_RCM_dir(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                          The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCM_Dir_Cyt.sif     Directed-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible (.sif file)
