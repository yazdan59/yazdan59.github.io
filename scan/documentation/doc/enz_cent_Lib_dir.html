%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds an Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Network.
 For every metabolite, the algorithm checks availability in the Library file which has been prepared by user as input in .txt format).
 and removes if it exists in the library file. Then the Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Network will be created.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_Lib_dir(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                         The Library file includes pre-defined currency metabolites (in .txt format)
 Note: Library text file must include one metabolites per line (all in one column) 
 fileName2                         The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Enzyme_Cent_Lib_Dir_Cyt.sif     Directed-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible
