%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 The Remove Currency Metabolites based-on Library (RCMLib) algorithm removes currency metabolites 
 in the metabolic network automatically IF AND ONLY IF the currency metabolits exists in the Library file.
 This file also contains single nodes (without any edges) in Cytoscape-compatible files.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_RCMLib_single_node(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                                  The Library file includes pre-defined currency metabolites (in .txt format)
 Note: Library text file must include one metabolites per line (all in one column) 
 fileName2                                  The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Removed_Mets_RCMLib.dat                  file contains removed metabolits from the original model
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCMLib.dat                   Undirected-Enzyme-Enzyme Network (comma separated Format)
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCMLib_single_node_Cyt.dat   Undirected-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible
