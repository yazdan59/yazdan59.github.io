<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> Builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks Removing Currency Metabolites (based-on a Library file)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds Directed Enzyme-Enzyme Networks.
 The Remove Currency Metabolites based-on Library (RCMLib) algorithm removes currency metabolites 
 in the metabolic network automatically IF AND ONLY IF the currency metabolits exists in the Library file.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = enz_cent_RCMLib_dir(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                          The Library file includes pre-defined currency metabolites (in .txt format)
 Note: Library text file must include one metabolites per line (all in one column) 
 fileName2                          The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Enzyme_Cent_RCMLib_Dir_Cyt.sif   Directed-Enzyme-Enzyme Network - Cytoscape Compatible
