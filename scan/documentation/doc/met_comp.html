%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads two Metabolic Network SBML files,
 compares them and finds metabolites which are not in common among these models.
 Then, write the differences in output files.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = met_comp(fileName1,fileName2)

INPUTS
 fileName1                               The first metabolic Network in the SBML format
 fileName2                               The second metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_mets_filename1_not_in_filename2.dat   Metabolites in the first SBML file which do not exist in the second SBML file
 *_mets_filename2_not_in_filename1.dat   Metabolites in the second SBML file which do not exist in the first SBML file
