%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 The function reads a Metabolic Network SBML file and builds Stoichiometric Matrix,
 Binary Stoichiometric Matrix, and Metabolite-Metabolite Networks.
 Note: COBRA Toolbox must be installed in MATLAB before running this function

 [Output] = met_cent(fileName)

INPUTS
 fileName                        The metabolic Network in the SBML format
 
OUTPUTS
 *_Stoich_Matrix.dat             Stoichiometric Matrix (comma separated Format)
 *_Binary_Stoich_Matrix.dat      Binary Stoichiometric Matrix (comma separated Format)
 *_Metabolite_Cent.dat           Undirected-Metabolite-Metabolite Network (comma separated Format)
 *_Metabolite_Cent_Cyt.dat       Undirected-Metabolite-Metabolite Network - Cytoscape Compatible
