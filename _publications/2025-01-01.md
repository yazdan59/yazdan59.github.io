In this study, we propose a new approach called MPSG (Meta-analysis model adapted for Pleiotropy Selection with Group structure) which performs a penalized multivariate meta-analysis method adapted for pleiotropy and takes into account the group structure information nested in the data to select relevant variants and genes (or pathways) from all the genetic information.
