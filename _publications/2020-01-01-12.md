excerpt: 'In this paper, we have used a systems biology approach to find more suitable targets in order to restore NIS expression in ATC cells. We have built a simplified protein interaction network including transcription factors and proteins involved in signaling pathways which regulate sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) expression.'

In this paper, we have used a systems biology approach to find more suitable targets in order to restore NIS expression in ATC cells. We have built a simplified protein interaction network including transcription factors and proteins involved in signaling pathways which regulate sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) expression.
