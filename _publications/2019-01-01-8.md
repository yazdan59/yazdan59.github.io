excerpt: 'In this paper, we have used deterministic and stochastic approaches to show that the average and the standard deviation of ligand binding capacity indeed differ between positive and negative cooperativity in some protein multimers. Considering standard deviation as a measure of noise in the system, our results demonstrated that this source of noise enables the system to adapt in a fluctuating environment and could be subject to selection during evolution.'

In this paper, we have used deterministic and stochastic approaches to show that the average and the standard deviation of ligand binding capacity indeed differ between positive and negative cooperativity in some protein multimers. Considering standard deviation as a measure of noise in the system, our results demonstrated that this source of noise enables the system to adapt in a fluctuating environment and could be subject to selection during evolution.
