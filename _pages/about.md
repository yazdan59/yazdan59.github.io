I am a bioinformatician and I work as a researcher in the biomedical field in France.
<br><br>
I had to go through a long journey to become a bioinformatician, as I had always wanted to be a scientist since my undergraduate degree. I strongly believe that science does not belong to any particular country or region, and that all scientific findings should be openly accessible and reproducible by everyone. My dream is to one day see that a project I worked on has led to an achievement that makes life easier for people around the world.
<br><br>
Currently, I am working on the application of GWAS summary statistic data to identify common genetic factors responsible for both Breast and Thyroid cancers.
