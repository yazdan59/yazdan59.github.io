I am bioinformatician and I work as a researcher in biomedical field in France.
<br><br>
I passed a long way to be a bioinformatician. I always wanted to be a scientist and since bachelor degree, I tried so hard for that. I believe that the science does not belong to any particular country or region and all the scientific findings should be open access to every one and also be reproducible. My dream is some day I could see that one part of a project that I worked in before led to an achievement makes life easier for people around the world.
<br><br>
Now, I am working on application of GWAS summary statistic data and try to find common genetic factors responsible for both Breast and Thyroid cancers.
