I am a bioinformatician and now a postdoc fellowship at Exposome and Heredity Team at Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), France.
I always wanted to be a scientist and since bachelor degree, I tried so hard for that. I believe that the science does not belong to any particular country or region and all the scientific findings should be open access to every one and also be reproducible. My dream is some day I could see that one part of a project that I worked in before led to an achievement makes life easier for people around the world.
Now, I am working on application of GWAS summary statistics data in Breast and Thyroid cancers.

#A data-driven personal website
#======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
