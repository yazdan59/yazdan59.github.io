I am a bioinformatician and now a postdoc fellowship at Exposome and Heredity Team at Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), France.
</br>
I always wanted to be a scientist and since bachelor degree, I tried so hard for that. I believe that the science does not belong to any particular country or region and all the scientific findings should be open access to every one and also be reproducible. My dream is some day I could see that one part of a project that I worked in before led to an achievement makes life easier for people around the world.
</br>
Now, I am working on application of GWAS summary statistics data in Breast and Thyroid cancers.
