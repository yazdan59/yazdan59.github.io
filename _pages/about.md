I am a bioinformatician and now I work as a researcher in the biomedical field in France.
<br><br>
I had to go through a long journey to become a bioinformatician, as I had always wanted to be a scientist since my undergraduate degree. I strongly believe that science does not belong to any particular country or region, and that all scientific findings should be openly accessible and easily reproducible by everyone. My ultimate aspiration is to witness one of my projects contribute to a breakthrough that enhances the lives of people worldwide.
<br><br>
Currently, I am working on the application of GWAS summary statistic data to identify common genetic risk factors between different types of cancers.
